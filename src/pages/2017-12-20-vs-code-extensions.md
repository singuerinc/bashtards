1. [Settings Sync](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Shan.code-settings-sync)

    If you have two computers, or we switch between VS Code and VS Code Insiders you need this extension. It synchronize the whole editor's configuration. It also install/uninstall the extensions. 100% recommended.

    Cons: Sometimes you get some conflicts with the configuration during upload/download.

1. [Bracket Pair Colorizer](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=CoenraadS.bracket-pair-colorizer)

    You should avoid spaghetti code, callback hell, and files with more than 60 lines of code. But in some cases you need an extra help to see where the f*** that statement ends. Bracket adds extra colors to identify clearly that.

    Cons: Sometimes it pollute too much your theme.

1. [Git Lens](https://github.com/eamodio/vscode-gitlens)

    If you work with git (someone here that still with SVN? xD) this is a must. It adds tons of git extra tools to VS Code.

1. [Prettier - Code formatter](https://prettier.io/)

    Don't worry any more about removing extra spaces, fix that indentation... Define how to format your code and let Prettier to do the rest. Set `editor.formatOnSave: true` and you get auto-formatting.

1. [ESLint](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-eslint) / [TSLint](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-tslint)
