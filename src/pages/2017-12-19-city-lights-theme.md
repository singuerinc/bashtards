This is by far my favorite theme: [City Lights](http://citylights.xyz/)

Everything it's beautiful: the [website](http://citylights.xyz/) looks great, seems that they really enjoyed creating this theme.
I mean, the color selection it's quiet classical: red for the numbers, blue for the strings, orange for the params. But what it makes unique is that everything seems to work in harmony.
It's dark, but not black. It's simple enough to not interfere but fully functional.

There is a downside: It's not available in the official Marketplace, so you cannot install it from VSCode. You should clone the repository directly:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Yummygum/city-lights-syntax-vsc.git ~/.vscode/extensions/city-lights-theme
```
